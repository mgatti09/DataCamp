    "### Why Python?\n",
    "Python has become the lingua franca for many data science applications. It combines the power of general-purpose programming languages with the ease of use of domain-specific scripting languages like MATLAB or R. Python has libraries for data\n",
    "loading, visualization, statistics, natural language processing, image processing, and more. This vast toolbox provides data scientists with a large array of general- and special-purpose functionality. One of the main advantages of using Python is the ability to interact directly with the code, using a terminal or other tools like the Jupyter Notebook, which weâ€™ll look at shortly. Machine learning and data analysis are fundamentally iterative processes, in which the data drives the analysis. It is essential for these processes to have tools that allow quick iteration and easy interaction.\n",
    "As a general-purpose programming language, Python also allows for the creation of complex graphical user interfaces (GUIs) and web services, and for integration into existing systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "- General purpose programming language (can be used to make anything)\n",
    "- Easy to read and write (and learn!)\n",
    "- One of the most popular languages for data science\n",
    "- Preferred by computer scientists and programmers\n",
    "- Language of choice for cutting edge machine learning and AI applications\n",
    "- Commonly used for putting models \"in production\"\n",
