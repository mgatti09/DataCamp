Now, you'll connect to a MySQL database, for which many prefer to use the `pymysql` database driver, which, like `psycopg2` for PostgreSQL, you have to install prior to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "This connection string is going to start with `'mysql+pymysql://'`, indicating which dialect and driver you're using to establish the connection. The dialect block is followed by the `'username:password'` combo. Next, you specify the host and port with the following `'@host:port/'`. Finally, you wrap up the connection string with the `'database_name'`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now you'll practice connecting to a `MySQL database`: it will be the same `census` database that you have already been working with. One of the great things about **SQLAlchemy is that, after connecting, it abstracts over the type of database it has connected to and you can write the same SQLAlchemy code, regardless!**\n",

To work around that issue, you can get blocks of rows from the ResultProxy by using the `.fetchmany()` method inside a `loop`. With `.fetchmany()`, give it an argument of the number of records you want. When you reach an empty list, there are no more rows left to fetch, and you have processed all the results of the query. Then you need to use the `.close()` method to close out the connection to the database.\n",
